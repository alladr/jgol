This project is a variation on the Conwayâ€™s game of life.
The basic ideas are:
- I have four state;
- for each state there is another state stronger and one weaker;
- each cell can have only one state;
- the initial state is random;
- then, the state change according to the strongest state in the surrounding, or randomly if there is not a strongest state.

If someone is in a specific context, which is the influence of the context in taking up certain ideas? Who wins between aggressivity, rationality, elusion and charme?
No, ok, it's just a programming exercise.

At this time there is a problem, because the order of if-clauses (in the strongest idea definition) affects the panorama. In generale I have to improve the strongest-state definition.

It uses pygame, random, collections.
