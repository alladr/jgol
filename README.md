This project is a variation on the Conwayâ€™s game of life.
The basic ideas are:
- I have four state;
- for each state there is another state stronger and one weaker;
- each cell can have only one state;
- the initial state is random;
- then, the state change according to the strongest state in the surrounding, or randomly.

If a person is in a specific context, which is the probability that person inherits the strongest idea in his/her context?
It's just an exercise.
At this time there is a problem, because the order of if-clauses (in the strongest idea definition) affects the panorama.

It uses pygame, random, collections.
